This is my playground of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SVG and more. These small tools are created using modern web standards. It means you can just run these web apps on any modern web browser, like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft IE(9 or later). D3.js and React.js are the main libraries and frameworks involved in the development of the site. Thanks to GitHub Pages, it becomes possible to present these small tools for biologists online. All these tools are aimed to help bench scientists to make their lives easier. Currently, the following tools are available. More functionalities are coming. Please stay tuned.
